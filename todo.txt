Production-Grade Recommendations:

Use HTTPS and secure credentials/secrets everywhere (Jenkins, JFrog, SonarQube, etc.).
Add resource limits/requests and readiness/liveness probes to Kubernetes deployments.
Implement RBAC and network policies in Kubernetes.
Use managed databases and storage for SonarQube and Jenkins.
Set up monitoring/logging (Prometheus, Grafana, ELK, etc.).
Automate backup and disaster recovery for stateful services.
Use Terraform remote state and state locking.
Harden Docker images (scan for vulnerabilities, use minimal base images).
Enable audit logging and access controls in all tools.
Document operational runbooks and incident response.
